I found these tutorials you gave us very resourceful and helpful. If these didn't exist, I would be lost in the fourth dimension. Thank you so, so much. 
I have a mediocre knowledge of computers and the internet. Usually, I'm busy watching anime, reading manga/manhwa, and playing video games. I don't really think it affects the experience of me navigating through these tutorials. It's not excessive like Xenoblade Chronicles 2; every single step I'm led is very informative. Bottom line: I'm fine, I'm okay.

(I'm answering question #1)
In my opinion, people with experience helping the unexperienced is the best thing. It's like that one meme of one guy showing some other guy something on the computer, and the other guy is like "oooooh". I think to a moderate extent, it relates to someone trying to download and play a game. Just call for help, maybe someone like Faker or a grandmaster esports champion to help you navigate around Steam to find the pay and download button.
